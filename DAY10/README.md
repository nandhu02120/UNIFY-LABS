Brand Authentication Page Clone — DAY10

This folder contains a high-fidelity Instagram-style authentication page with a responsive "Our Team" section built using HTML and vanilla CSS.

Files:
- index.html — main demo page
- styles.css — modular, responsive CSS
- assets/*.svg — avatar images used in the team section

Open `index.html` in a browser to preview. The layout is mobile-first and uses HTML5 validation attributes. The form uses floating labels and focus glow effects for advanced UX.
