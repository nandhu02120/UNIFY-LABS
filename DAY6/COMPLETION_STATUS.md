## 📝 Notes for Future Self

### Remember These Key Points
1. **Git is local, GitHub is cloud** - Two separate but linked concepts
2. **Commits are snapshots** - Not incremental changes but full states
3. **Push regularly** - Never rely on just local storage
4. **Branch for features** - Don't work on main directly
5. **Clear messages matter** - Future you (and team) will thank you

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Forgetting to push (code only on your machine)
- ❌ Large commits mixing features (hard to debug later)
- ❌ Vague commit messages (can't find code later)
- ❌ Working on main branch (breaks shared code)
- ❌ Committing credentials (security nightmare)

### Pro Tips Learned
- ✅ Commit early and often
- ✅ Write commits for future you
- ✅ Push at end of each day
- ✅ Keep .gitconfig backed up
- ✅ Use meaningful branch names
