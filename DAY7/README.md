# DAY7 — Unified Component Library

This folder contains a single-page CSS-only component library demo showcasing:

- Responsive navigation bar (CSS checkbox hack, no JavaScript)
- Dark / Light mode toggle using CSS variables defined in `:root` and overridden via the checkbox hack
- Three advanced animated buttons: Neon Glow, Rotating Border, Hover Micro-animation

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the demo. The CSS is in `styles.css`.
